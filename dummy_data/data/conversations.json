From there, take any bus heading towards Deira City Centre or Dubai Mall via Sheikh Zayed Road. Specifically, look out for buses with route numbers like 101, 102, or 103. These routes frequently pass through the area around Tea Junction. The journey typically takes about 20-30 minutes depending on traffic.\n\nIf you prefer a slightly longer bus ride, you can also take a bus from Al Jafiliya Bus Station to Deira Central Bus Station and then transfer to another route heading towards Dubai Mall or Downtown Dubai. This might involve a short walk in Deira after your transfer but will still get you close to the iftar options available.\n\nRemember to check the current timetable for the most convenient times, as bus frequencies can vary throughout the day.

One of the closest options is a cafe called \"Baker Street Bakery\" at 1 km away. You can take Bus Route 32 from Al Jafiliya bus stop towards Al Barsha South and get off at the first stop, which will be near Baker Street Bakery.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider taking Bus Route 45 to Al Ghubra Road, where there are several cafes offering iftar meals within a short walking distance. Just ask for directions to \"Al Ghubra Road\" when you board the bus.\n\nRemember, Tim Hortons is quite close by too, at about 620 meters away! If you decide to visit them first and then look for an iftar spot, feel free to ask any of our friendly drivers for assistance in finding your way. Enjoy your meal!"

The distance to Al Farooq Mosque is approximately 3.5 kilometers, which should take around 15-20 minutes by foot if you're comfortable walking.\n\nFor your convenience, I would recommend taking a bus from the Al Jafiliya Bus Station towards the direction of Al Wahda Mall or Al Barsha Heights. The buses in this area are frequent and reliable. You'll likely see signs directing you to mosques along these routes. Boarding at either stop should be straightforward.\n\nIf walking isn't ideal, consider taking a short taxi ride from the station directly to the mosque. This option can save time if you're carrying prayer mats or other items. The journey would take just a few minutes, depending on traffic.\n\nRemember to check the timetable for any last-minute changes in bus schedules, especially during special prayer times like taraweeh. Safe travels!"

It\u2019s a frequent service that runs specifically along this corridor and should get you to Masjid Al Wasl with minimal transfers.
